# Getting Started

This folder will cover the following topics:
- Installing Purescript
- Getting familiar with the REPL
- Other info you should know before working through the other folders in this project

## Why Learn PureScript?

This question can be answered by explaining three things:
- Why one should use Javascript to build programs...
- ...but not write Javascript to build it...
- ...and write Purescript instead of alternatives

### Why one should use Javascript to build programs...

TODO, but the general idea:
- The web browser is the new ["dumb terminal"](https://www.youtube.com/embed/YI34UIMgkxs?start=1762&end=1828) / platform-independent OS:
    - [What can web do today?](https://whatwebcando.today/)
- Progressive web applications are better than native web apps in a few important ways
- WebAssembly
- The points mentioned in this article: [Learn Javascript in 2018](https://hackernoon.com/learn-to-code-in-2018-get-hired-and-have-fun-along-the-way-b338247eed6a)

### ...but not write Javascript to build it...

The benefits of strong types:
- Types == UML diagrams
- The types guide how something should be implemented
- The compiler can infer runtime code
- Certain classes of bugs are eliminated

TODO, but the general idea is:
- dynamic typing -> runtime errors
- a linter is just a basic static type checker
- easier to write, read, and understand a 'safer language' that compiles to efficient Javascript
- alternatives: Typescript, Coffeescript, Elm, etc.
- [OO "design patterns" in FP languages](http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/05/design-patterns-in-haskel/)

### ...and write Purescript instead of alternatives

TODO, but the general idea is:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=22&v=5AtyWgQ3vv0
- type-level programming
- compiles to other backends beside Javascript
