# Build Tools

This folder accomplishes the following:

- Explain the various tools used throughout the ecosystem and their usages/differences:
    - Document the differences between `Bower` and `psc-package` dependency managers
    - Document the difference between `pulp` and `purs-loader` build tools
- Document the CLI options for the most popular tools (e.g. purs, pulp, psc-package, etc.)
- Document a typical workflow from project start to finish (creation, fast-feedback development, initial publishing, 'bump' publishing)

## Overview of Tools

The following seem to be deprecated or no longer used:

| Name | Type/Usage | Comments | URL |

For this repo, we will be using `pulp` for our build tool and `psc-package` for our dependency manager.
