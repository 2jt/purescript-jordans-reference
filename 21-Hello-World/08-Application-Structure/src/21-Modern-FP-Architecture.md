## Evaluating MTL and Free

Let's now examine one post's criteria for each approach. The following is my guess at where things stand^^:

| | Extensible? | Composable? | Efficient? | Terse? | Inferrable?
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| MTL | Yes via the Capability Design Pattern | Yes via newtyped monadic functions? | ? | ~`n^2` instances for `Monad[Word]`<br>boilerplate capability type classes | ? |
| Free/Run | Yes via open rows and `VariantF` | Yes via embedded domain-specific languages | ? | boilerplate smart constructors | ? |

^^ Note: The `MTL vs Free` debate is pretty heated in FP communities.

In the `Hello World/Games` folder, we'll implement the same programs for each concept mentioned above as more concrete examples.
