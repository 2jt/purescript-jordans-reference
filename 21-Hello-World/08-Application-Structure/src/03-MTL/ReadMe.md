# MTL

This folder does 3 things:
- walks the reader through the problems that led us to define the `MonadState` in the way that it is and uses this idea to teach the general idea behind all the other monad transformers
- overviews each monad transformer
- explains what problem `MonadTrans` solves and how the 'monad transformer stack' works

## Setting Your Expectations

**The upcoming code examples for each type class may seem pointless at first because the program doesn't do anything "useful." That's intentional for teaching purposes.** Each monad transformer needs to be studied separately to increase familiarity. Once we understand how they work individually, we can start to combine them together using "monad transformers."
