# Application Structure

The upcoming folders will explain
- the principle behind structuring FP programs
- how to structure an FP program via
    - MTL (Monad Transforms Library)
    - Free/Run

These will later be used to write games/programs that run in Node via the console and in the Browser via Halogen
