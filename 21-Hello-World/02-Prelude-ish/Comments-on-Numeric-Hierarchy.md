# Comments on Numeric Hierarchy

Monoids
- What is the `Maps(X, M)` mean?

Groups
- In particular, when m=12, we have seen that 15∈3¯¯¯, and 27∈3¯¯¯, but 2∉1¯¯¯. It turns out that in this case, 15¯¯¯¯¯ is actually the exact same set as 3¯¯¯, and again the exact same set as 27¯¯¯¯¯.
  - I'm not sure how to read this: 15∈3¯¯¯
    - since we are using x, y and m, and m has already been specified to 12, what is 15 and 3? It requires reviewing what it said earlier to figure out instead of just explaining that syntax as a whole.
