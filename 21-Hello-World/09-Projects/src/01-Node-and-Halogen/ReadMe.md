# Node and Halogen

Rather than explaining some concepts alongside of the application structure ideas, I decided to explain enough here so that we can focus on other issues in our actual games.


| Name | Program Types |
| - | - |
| Node | console-based programs |
| Halogen | web-based programs |

Note: one could also use `React`, but I'm not including it here.
