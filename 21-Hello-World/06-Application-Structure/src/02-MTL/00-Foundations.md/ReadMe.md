# Foundations

Many people find it very difficult to understand how Monad Transformers actually work. I believe it's because new learners are exposed to too many new things at once, so that they get overwhelemed and likely don't understand why they don't understand.

Rather than jumping into an explanation of what monad transformers are, I'm going to build the necessary scaffolding to make understanding them easier and also show what problem they solve.

## Folder's Contents

In this folder, we'll show that a `Function` can be a Monad.

After that, we'll present code and the problems that arise with it that helps one see why Monad Transformers are needed and used in FP programs.
