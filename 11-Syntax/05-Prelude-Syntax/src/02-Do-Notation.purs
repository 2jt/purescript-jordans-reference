{-
In imperative programming, one often writes some sequential code like:
  x = 4
  y = x + 4
  z = toString x
  print z

Since each line depends on the line before it,
  this implies sequential computation, or Monads. We have "do" notation
  to imitate this style of code
-}

-- example:
-- computation >>= (\result -> newComputationUsing result)

do1_1Line :: Box Unit

    -- only call `add4To x` if `get4` actually produces something
    add4To x >>= (\y ->
      toString y >>= (\z ->
        print z

do4_discard_syntax :: Box Unit
do4_discard_syntax = do                                           {-
  When we omit the "binding <-" syntax, as in

      four <- Box 4   -- line 1
              Box a   -- line 2
      five <- Box 5   -- line 3

  the compiler translates `line 2` to
      "discard (Box a) (\_ -> (Box 5) >>= (\five -> ... ))"

  This is fine if the argument to the next function would be Unit

      four <- Box 4
      unit <- Box unit  -- here, we could omit the "unit <-" syntax
      five <- Box 5

  If we had accidentally written code that amounted to this...

      four <- Box 4
      unit <- Box 10
      five <- Box 5

  ... the compiler would notify us that we had discarded a non-unit value
      "Could not find instance of Discard for Int"

  Why does it do this? To highlight accidentally dropping results
  If you want to intentionally drop a result, use `void $ monad`            -}
  x <- (Box 5)
  (Box unit) -- since it returns unit, it's ok to use discard here

  -- rather than write this...
  map (\_ -> unit) (Box 5)

  -- or even this...
  (\_ -> unit) <$> (Box 5)

  -- we write this:
  void $ Box 5

  print 5
