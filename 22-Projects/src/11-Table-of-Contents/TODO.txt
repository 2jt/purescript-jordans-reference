    - add failed links into list
        - global state? / Writer monad
    - at end of program, if list not empty, print out failed links and 'crash'
        - "crash on failure" option
- write pre-req for
    - traversable
    - parallel
        - how it works and why useful
        - pattern to follow to get it to work for your AppM type

Future work for eventual release
- rewrite code using Run
- add tests
- make it type-safe
    - URI

Future Ideas
- limit the header depth to output
- 'lift' level not-2 headers to level 2 if root does not exist
- control which files actually get parsed for headers
