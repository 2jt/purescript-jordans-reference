# Table of Contents

In this folder, we will build a program that can recursively parse this project's files and automatically-create a Table of Contents file.

The libraries we will cover here are:
- Yargs - bindings to a JavaScript command line parser library
- Node-FS - bindings to Node's file system API
- `purescript-tree` - A Rose Tree
- `purescript-string-parsers` - Parser library when content is known to be a `String`.
