# Projects

If you walked me through a complete but simple program from initial design to complete testing, what would that process look like?
   - [Random Number Game](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-random-number-game) - a very simple game that runs on the console and in the browser using the same "business logic".
   - [Mdbook ToC Generator](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-mdbook-generator) - a script that produces the necessary table of contents file used by `mdbook` to produce the website for this work. This script isn't documented very well.
